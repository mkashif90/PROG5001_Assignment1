Pseudo Code:

Algorithm 1:

1. Start
2. Calling the function GetMaxMarks(marks) to get highest marks and passing it array of marks.
3. Storing highest marks in varibale maxMarks = GetMaxMarks(marks);
4. Printing the marks received in  maxMarks variable, System.out.println("Highest marks obtained in this unit are: "+ maxMarks);       
5. Calling the function GetMinMarks(marks) to get lowest marks and passing it array of marks.
6. Storing lowest marks in varibale minMarks = GetMinMarks(marks);
7. Printing the marks received in  minMarks variable, System.out.println("Lowest marks obtained in this unit are: "+ minMarks);         
8. Declaring a public function which receives array of marks in double variable.     
9. Declaring and intializing the maxValue variable with array first element value, double maxValue = marksReceived[0];      
10. Executing for loop till the length of Array to itirritate through the Array of marks, for(int k=0;k<marksReceived.length;k++){
11. Checking of current value is greater than the value stored in maxValue variable.
12. If current value in the array list is greater then storing it to the MaxValue variable
13. Return the maxValue to the function call. 
14. Closing the function.
15. Declaring a new public function which receives array of marks in double variable to calculate lowest marks.     
16. Declaring and intializing the minValue variable with array first element value, double minValue = marksReceived[0];      
17. Executing for loop till the length of Array to itirritate through the Array of marks, for(int k=0;k<marksReceived.length;k++){
18. Checking of current value is lower than the value stored in minValue variable.
19. If current value in the array list is lower then storing it to the minValue variable
20. Return the minValue to the function call.
21. Closing the function.    
22. End


Algorithm 2:

1. Start
2. Declaring and intializing variable meanValue  to calculate the meanValue of the marks.
3. Declaring and intializing variable sum  to calculate the sum of the marks.
4. Declaring and intializing variable sum2 to calculate the sum of the marks to use in deviation calculation function.
5. Declaring and intializing variable dev to calculate the standard deviation of the marks.
6. Starting for loop till the length of marks array.
7. Adding up the values of marks in sum variable
8. Calculating the Mean Value by using mean value formula meanValue = sum/marks.length;      
9. Again Starting for loop till the length of marks array.        
10. Calculating sum for deviation by following formula sum2 = sum2 + Math.pow(marks[n] - meanValue, 2);
11. Loop ends Calculating sum for deviation by following formula dev = Math.sqrt(sum2/(marks.length-1));
12. Printing the mean and standard deviation of the marks.
13. End
